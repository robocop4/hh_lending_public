The **Artifex Developer Bug Bounty Program** is designed to improve the security and quality of their key software products — **Ghostscript, GhostPDL, and MuPDF**. While reports for website properties (artifex.com, ghostscript.com, mupdf.com, smartoffice.com) are accepted, they are rewarded only with a **letter of recognition** and **no monetary payments**.
