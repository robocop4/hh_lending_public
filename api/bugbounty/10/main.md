**Parity Bug Bounty Program Summary**  

**Purpose:**  
The Parity Bug Bounty Program encourages the community and security researchers to identify vulnerabilities in Parity’s blockchain-related software and infrastructure, helping make Parity systems more secure.  

**Scope — What’s In Scope:**  
- **[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk):** Implementation bugs that can compromise Substrate-based chains without direct machine access, including issues in pallets and primitives.  
- **[Runtimes](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/):** Vulnerabilities that affect the intended behavior of blockchain runtimes like Kusama and Polkadot.  
- **Parity Releases Pipeline:** Bugs that could allow malicious code injection into distributed binaries or disrupt the release process.  
- **Production Infrastructure:** Publicly available infrastructure critical for network security or fund safety (excluding public websites).  
- **Polkadot-JS:** Vulnerabilities in [apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps), [extensions](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension), and [common](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common) repositories (third-party code is included only if it affects Parity's software).  

**Out of Scope — What’s NOT Covered:**  
- Static or dynamic websites (unless affecting user data for all visitors).  
- Bugs already reported, known, or publicly disclosed.  
- Vulnerabilities in third-party tools/services not maintained by Parity.  
- Parity employees or contractors; social engineering attacks.  
- Actions violating the spirit or rules of the program.  

**Responsible Reporting Guidelines:**  
- Use only your own accounts or test accounts; avoid accessing or storing user or Parity data.  
- Avoid harming services, users, or privacy.  
- Do not use physical attacks, social engineering, spam, or DDoS.  
- Report bugs privately to bugbounty@parity.io and maintain confidentiality.  
- Allow Parity reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure.  
- Provide clear, reproducible proof-of-concept or evidence.  

**Eligibility Requirements:**  
- Bug must be original, affecting Parity’s code (not contributed by you or a third-party maintained separately).  
- Submitters must be legally eligible to receive rewards and not employed by Parity.  
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for personal gain or cause damage.  
- Must comply with all applicable laws and program rules.  

**Rewards:**  
- Minimum reward: $100 USD equivalent in KSM.  
- Higher rewards at Parity’s discretion for severe issues affecting users.  
- Each bug is eligible for only one reward; proof of identity and KSM address required.  

**Legal Notes:**  
- Program governed by laws of England and Wales.  
- Actions in good faith within scope are considered legitimate; illegal or harmful actions are not covered.  
- Privacy information collected includes name, email, ID, and blockchain address; handled per Parity’s privacy policy.
